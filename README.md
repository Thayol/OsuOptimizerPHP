# osu! optimizer (PHP)

Samsz has seen most of my work and it was his idea to combine them together before I start writing another one from scratch.

> "Swiss Army Knife style osu! library manager" -- Samsz

## What's this?

This is my attempt at making a somewhat functional multitool for your library. I've had many separate smaller projects in various languages, but I decided to stick with PHP.

There is no real programming style or pattern set for this project, so it's kind of undocumented and hard to read.

Pull requests are welcome! I doubt this project would get any traffic, so feel free to message me directly about basically anything.

## Features

 - [x] Replace all backgrounds with 1x1 black images

 - [ ] Export maps to .osz

 - [ ] Blacklist: the maps that should not be touched by this program

## Warning!

You should always back up your osu! folder before using programs of these kinds. I will include a somewhat legal disclaimer just in case.
